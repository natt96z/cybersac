**★Core Knowledge★ -** We need computer ethics to differentiate from what's right and wrong. The technology we used today can be easily misused and can become an easy security threat, not for just people, but entire network infrastructures as well. The tools we utilize should always be used for good, to help others with tasks like safe data recovery, basic computer repair, network organization and security hardening. Also, if you see something, say something. It could be a life altering issue that needs to be handled correctly. Be more of a White Hat hacker over a black hat one, bring peace not war!(More information can be found above in the Unit 3 learning material section of this page)

**Things you should never do: (4 Major Nevers)**


1) Never use a computer to steal from others. (Stealing bank details, scamming through emails)

2) Never use a computer to harm others. (Whether it is on a personal level or damaging another person's hardware)

3) Never use a computer to illegally copy licensed software. (Software you haven't subbed or purchased)

4) Never use a computer's resources without the correct permissions from authority. (Always ask first)

**Software Security NOTE:** It's always smart to regularly install security updates for Windows through its Windows security applet. This can also be done with other 3rd party security suites as well. Windows Defender is preinstalled on most computers, these days, and offers comprehensive tools to keep your PC safe. 3rd party alternatives, like BitDefender and Malware Bytes, do a great job as well.

**Software security Recommendation:** As a built-in malware scanner for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Defender Antivirus will look for any files or programs, on your computer, that could harm it as part of the Windows Security suite. Defender scans email, apps, the cloud, and the web for software threats, including viruses and other malware. It's also, constantly, updating with new securitry definitions to fix critical Windows exploits.

**Core Knowledge:** Ubuntu is an open-source operating system (OS) built on the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. Ubuntu offers a more secure and private operating system. The main benefit of using Ubuntu is that, we can get the extra security and privacy, we need without using any third-party solutions.
By using this Linux distribution, the risk of hackers breaking into our PC's servers and, especially, virtual machines, is minimal to almost non-exsistant with certian useful techniques.

**Windows Security Always Has User Error, Linux Can HELP!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Windows will generate an administrator account for you when you install it, giving you complete control, to do pretty much whatever you want, with the operating system, by using the mysterious "Run as administrator" options. On the other hand, Linux does not permit such permissions by default; you are free to use your home directory, but you must enter the root password, each time you want, to perform a system-level activity. Here's the thing: With the right configuration, Windows can be just as safe as Linux. However, for decades, Windows' default installation has handled user permissions incorrectly and at risk. 

A user can easily run a program, as administrator, on Windows. While on Linux, you have to enter the root password whenever you want to do so. In this way, you can notice when a script or a program tries to do something system-wide.

**Installation on Linux is SECURE and getting easier to use!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Users, typically, utilize the internet to search for an EXE or MSI file, download it, and install software on Windows. Due to the uncertainty surrounding, this source's reliability, there is a significant security risk. On the other hand, Linux makes use of a tool called a package manager. Simply defined, a package manager, is in charge of obtaining the packages you require from reliable sources, known as repositories. Much of the time, the community manages repositories, and the verification and acceptance process for packages is laborious. They, also, simplify things for the user, because there is no need to browse the internet or look up files to download; all you need to do is type a short command. Most popular package installer stores are Ubuntu Software Center and PLING, which are the biggest repositories of apps ever.
