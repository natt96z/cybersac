**★Core Knowledge★ -** We need computer ethics to differentiate from what's right and wrong. The technology we used today can be easily misused and can become an easy security threat, not for just people, but entire network infrastructures as well. The tools we utilize should always be used for good, to help others with tasks like safe data recovery, basic computer repair, network organization and security hardening. Also, if you see something, say something. It could be a life altering issue that needs to be handled correctly. Be more of a White Hat hacker over a black hat one, bring peace not war!(More information can be found above in the Unit 3 learning material section of this page)

**Things you should never do: (4 Major Nevers)**


1) Never use a computer to steal from others. (Stealing bank details, scamming through emails)

2) Never use a computer to harm others. (Whether it is on a personal level or damaging another person's hardware)

3) Never use a computer to illegally copy licensed software. (Software you haven't subbed or purchased)

4) Never use a computer's resources without the correct permissions from authority. (Always ask first)

**Software Security NOTE:** It's always smart to regularly install security updates for Windows through its Windows security applet. This can also be done with other 3rd party security suites as well. Windows Defender is preinstalled on most computers, these days, and offers comprehensive tools to keep your PC safe. 3rd party alternatives, like BitDefender and Malware Bytes, do a great job as well.

**Windows Security Always Has User Error, Linux Can HELP!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Windows will generate an administrator account, for you when you install it, giving you complete control, to do pretty much whatever you want, with the operating system, by using the mysterious "Run as administrator" options. On the other hand, Linux does not permit such permissions by default; you are free to use your home directory, but you must enter the root password, each time you want, to perform a system-level activity. Here's the thing: With the right configuration, Windows can be just as safe as Linux. However, for decades, Windows' default installation has handled user permissions incorrectly and at risk. 

A user can easily run a program, as administrator, on Windows. While on Linux, you have to enter the root password whenever you want to do so. In this way, you can notice when a script or a program tries to do something system-wide.

**Installation on Linux is SECURE and getting easier to use!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Users, typically, utilize the internet to search for an EXE or MSI file, download it, and install software on Windows. Due to the uncertainty surrounding this source's reliability, there is a significant security risk. On the other hand, Linux makes use of a tool called a package manager. Simply defined, a package manager, is in charge of obtaining the packages you require from reliable sources, known as repositories. Much of the time, the community manages repositories, and the verification and acceptance process for packages is laborious. They, also, simplify things for the user, because there is no need to browse the internet or look up files to download; all you need to do is type a short command. Most popular package installer stores are Ubuntu Software Center and PLING, which are the biggest repositories of apps ever.

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Cisco Packet Tracer, is a cross-platform visual simulation tool, that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. The software allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.

   :align: center


**Management Plane** - The connection between the workstation and the device where the administrator monitors and configures services.

**Protocols** - telnet, NTP, Secure FTP, SNMP, and SSH; we work with the management plane either in-band using a shared management interface or out-of-band.

**Data Plane or Forwarding Plane** - The actual movement of data, based on what the device learned, from the control plane and processes and moves user traffic. 

**Service Plane** - subset of data plane traffic requires high touch handling by the device. 

**Control Plane** - Routing protocols and routers that talk with one another. Where the device learns what action to take on the data. No data moves until the control and this plane makes a decision on the best path to deliver the data.

Cisco Packet Tracer Exercise 1 (GUI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**INTRO!**:

:blue:`In this demonstration, we will be creating a network that has` **one switch and two client computers**. Our goal would be for the two computers to be able to communicate with each other. We'll just be using the **graphical user interface** (**GUI**) for this example. **Open a new Cisco Packet Tracer File**`

1. First we will be dragging out two computers from the **[End Devices]** category. This category can be found in the plane, bottum left of the screen

   :width: 35%
   :align: right
   
2. Once that is done, we will drag out a switch from **[Network devices]** → **[Switches]** category. The **[Switches]** is a subcategory of the **[Network Devices]** category. In this demonstration, we will be using the **2950T-24** for the switch selected

|
|

3. We will need to select a cable to allow the computers to physically send data to each other. Within the **[Connections]** category we will choose the **Copper Straight-Through** cable.

4. Once the **Copper Straight-Through** cable is selected, click on any of the two computers and select **FastEthernet0**. (In terms of a real word scenario, we are currently connecting an ethernet cable into an available ethernet port on a computer) 

5. Now move the mouse towards the switch and click on the switch. You will now see a lot more options to pick from. Options would include **FastEthernet0/1** all the way through **FastEthernet0/24**. There are also options to connect to **GigabitEthernet** ports. In this demonstration we will be connecting the end of the cable into port **FastEthernet0/1**.

6. Now repeat Step 3, 4, and 5 for the other computer you didn’t select at first. Now this time instead of selecting **FastEthernet0/1** for a port on the switch, select **FastEthernet0/2**.

As it stands the computers and switches are all physically prepared. Now we must head into the computers and configure them logically. (These next steps will all be done through the **graphical interface** that CISCO PACKET TRACER provides.)

The next few steps have us configuring a computer’s **IP Address**. One analogy that an **IP Address** can be thought of as, is just simply a name. Every computer must be given a “name” (IP) so it can communicate in the network. (You need a name so the envelope can be sent to them). In this case the computer does not have a IP address automatically configured, so we will have to **statically** configure it.

7. Click on any of the two computers we set up. A pop up window will appear with the **Physical** tab opened up. We will skip over this **Physical** tab and click the tab right of it, **Config**.

8. The Config tab will display two sub-categories. **GLOBAL** and **INTERFACE**. We will be heading into the **INTERFACE** category and select **FastEthernet0**. 

9. Now within the **FastEthernet0** tab, we will be implementing a **static IPv4** Address along side a **Subnet Mask**. Under **IP Configuration**, type **192.168.10.15**  into the text field of the **IPv4 Address**.

10. Type **255.255.255.0**  into the text field of Subnet Mask, which is still located under **IP Configuration**. (In most cases it’ll automatically be configured as **255.255.255.0** without even typing it)

There you go. We have logically configured one of the computers to be able to talk in the network. Now we will have to the same for the other computer you didn’t select at first. 

11. Close out of the first pop-up tab and repeat steps 7-10. This time instead of using  **192.168.10.15** for the **IPv4 Address**, type **192.168.10.16**.


Cisco Packet Tracer Exercise 2 (CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This next exercise will consist of configuring a switch and router with the help of **CISCO's Command Line Interface**!

When it comes to using Cisco IOS on routers and switches, don't stress. With enough time and pratice, you'll get the hang of using the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**! Below we'll help you get started! 


First things first, if you ever do feel stuck or don't know what command to use, just type in **?** into the CLI. This will give you a list of commands that are avaible at your disposel!
