**Software security NOTE:** Its always smart to regularly install security updates for Windows through its Windows security applet. This can also be done with other 3rd party security suites as well. Windows Defender is preinstalled on most computers these days and offers compehensive tools to keep your PC safe. 3rd party alternatives like BitDefender and MalwareBytes do a great job as well.

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Ophcrack is a common software boot cracking tool that can hack Windows passwords.The program includes the ability to import the hashes from a variety of formats, including dumping directly from the SAM files of Windows. On most computers, ophcrack can crack most passwords within minutes, maybe even seconds.

**★Core Knowledge★ -** This bootable OS has great cracking tools as well as software diagnostics software specifically for Windows OS's. This bootable USB os should be used at your own risk and can have damage on Windows OS with incorrect use.

**Software security Recommendation:** Bitwarden is a free and open-source password protection program that keeps private information, including login details for sites on the internet, in an encrypted vault.

**Windows Security Always Has User Error, Linux Can HELP!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Windows will generate an administrator account for you when you install it, giving you complete control to do pretty much whatever you want with the operating system by using the mysterious "Run as administrator" options. On the other hand, Linux does not permit such permissions by default; you are free to use your home directory, but you must enter the root password each time you want to perform a system-level activity. Here's the thing: With the right configuration, Windows can be just as safe as Linux. However, for decades, Windows' default installation has handled user permissions incorrectly and at risk. 

A user can easily run a program as administrator in Windows, while in Linux you have to enter the root password whenever you want to do so, this way you can notice when a script or a program tries to do something system-wide.

**Installation on Linux is SECURE and getting easier to use!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Users typically utilize the internet to search for an EXE or MSI file, download it, and install software on Windows. Due to the uncertainty surrounding this source's reliability, there is a significant security risk. On the other hand, Linux makes use of a tool called a package manager. Simply defined, a package manager is in charge of obtaining the packages you require from reliable sources known as repositories. Much of the time, the community manages repositories, and the verification and acceptance process for packages is laborious. They also simplify things for the user because there is no need to browse the internet or look up files to download; all you need to do is type a short command. Most popular package installer stores are Ubunu Software Centre and PLING are the biggest repositories of apps ever.

Setting up Proton VPN on Windows OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**★Core Knowledge★ -** What is Proton VPN? Your Internet connection is encrypted while you browse the internet with Proton VPN.
The robust security features of Proton VPN make sure that an intruder cannot eavesdrop on your connection by routing it through encrypted tunnels.
Additionally, it enables you to visit websites that may be restricted in your region.

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Cisco Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. The software allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.

.. Note:: When dealing with networking devices,there are three planes: the management, control, and data planes

**Management Plane** The connection between the workstation and the device Where the administrator monitors and configures services 

**Protocols** telnet, NTP, Secure FTP, SNMP, and SSH and we work with the management plane either in-band using a shared management interface or out-of-band 

**Data Plane or Forwarding Plane** The actual movement of data based on what the device learned from the control plane and processes and moves user traffic 

**Service Plane** - subset of data plane traffic, requires high touch handling by the device 

**Control Plane** Routing protocols and routers that talk with one another. Where the device learns what action to take on the data. No data moves until the control and this plane makes a decision on the best path to deliver the data.
