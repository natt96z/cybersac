.. Note:: This is a prime example of how a web browser handles visiting maliscious web pages with a content block warning screen.


For secured websites online: HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A website that uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https:// in its url.

.. Note:: This is a perfect example of a sketchy online website online thats not secure at all and is offering a "free" download of a game. It will lead you to a website that is trying to trick you into collecting personal information disguised as a fake account request.
