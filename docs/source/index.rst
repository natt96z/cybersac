This is a prime example of how a web browser handles visiting maliscious web pages with a content block warning screen.

.. note::
For secured websites online: HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A website that uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https:// in its url.
