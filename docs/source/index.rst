**Software security NOTE:** Its always smart to regularly install security updates for Windows through its Windows security applet. This can also be done with other 3rd party security suites as well. Windows Defender is preinstalled on most computers these days and offers compehensive tools to keep your PC safe. 3rd party alternatives like BitDefender and MalwareBytes do a great job as well.

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Ophcrack is a common software boot cracking tool that can hack Windows passwords.The program includes the ability to import the hashes from a variety of formats, including dumping directly from the SAM files of Windows. On most computers, ophcrack can crack most passwords within minutes, maybe even seconds.

**★Core Knowledge★ -** This bootable OS has great cracking tools as well as software diagnostics software specifically for Windows OS's. This bootable USB os should be used at your own risk and can have damage on Windows OS with incorrect use.

**Windows Security Always Has User Error, Linux Can HELP!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Windows will generate an administrator account for you when you install it, giving you complete control to do pretty much whatever you want with the operating system by using the mysterious "Run as administrator" options. On the other hand, Linux does not permit such permissions by default; you are free to use your home directory, but you must enter the root password each time you want to perform a system-level activity. Here's the thing: With the right configuration, Windows can be just as safe as Linux. However, for decades, Windows' default installation has handled user permissions incorrectly and at risk. 

A user can easily run a program as administrator in Windows, while in Linux you have to enter the root password whenever you want to do so, this way you can notice when a script or a program tries to do something system-wide.

**Installation on Linux is SECURE and getting easier to use!**

**★Core Knowledge★ -** Users typically utilize the internet to search for an EXE or MSI file, download it, and install software on Windows. Due to the uncertainty surrounding this source's reliability, there is a significant security risk. On the other hand, Linux makes use of a tool called a package manager. Simply defined, a package manager is in charge of obtaining the packages you require from reliable sources known as repositories. Much of the time, the community manages repositories, and the verification and acceptance process for packages is laborious. They also simplify things for the user because there is no need to browse the internet or look up files to download; all you need to do is type a short command. Most popular package installer stores are Ubunu Software Centre and PLING are the biggest repositories of apps ever.

**Bitdefender:** packs a huge collection of security-centric features, among them password management, enhanced security for online transactions, ransomware protection, Active Do Not Track, and even a VPN. The default Quick Actions lets you launch a quick system, or vulnerability scan, open the VPN, and configure Safepay online protection. You can configure the product to add a feature such as the File Shredder or Wallet password manager in the main display, and you can swap out features you do not use much.

**Webroot:** When it encounters an unknown app, it runs it in a bubble, preventing the app from making any permanent system changes until its cloud-based intelligence reaches a conclusion about the program. If it’s malicious, the tiny local Webroot program wipes out the attacker and reverses its actions. WEBROOT has a Near-perfect score in our malware protection and phishing protection tests. It is light on system resources, has fast scan capabilities, is tiny in size, and can remediate ransomware damage.

**Malwarebytes:** includes limited signature-based detection as one of its many layers, but relies heavily on more modern forms of detection. Web protection blocks traffic to known dangerous addresses, whether by the browser or by a malicious application. Ransomware protection watches for the behaviors that occur when an unknown program is getting ready to encrypt your files. It should catch even a zero-day ransomware attack, with no need to recognize anything but behaviors that suggest ransomware.

Exploit attacks take advantage of security holes in popular applications, using the security vulnerability to take control. Even if you keep your operating system and programs patched, there's always a window when the vulnerability is known, but not yet patched. Malwarebytes shields several dozen popular applications against attack. This is a generalized protection against exploit behaviors, not protection against specific exploits.
